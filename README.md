MARKDOWN 


**Intern:** Your Name  
**Task:** Create multiple passwords, test with online checkers, record scores, and summarize best practices.

## Files
- `Task6_PasswordStrength.md` — full report and analysis (passwords masked)
- `screenshots/` — password checker screenshots

## Summary
Tested multiple passwords (weak → strong) using passwordmeter.com and howsecureismypassword.net. Recorded scores, noted recommendations, and concluded that passphrases (12+ chars, mix of cases, numbers, symbols) provide best protection. Do not reuse real passwords; use a password manager.
